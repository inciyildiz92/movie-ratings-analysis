# 🎬 Movie Ratings Analysis Project

This project is a beginner-friendly data analysis exercise completed using **Python**, **Pandas**, and **Matplotlib**.  
It analyzes a small movie dataset to explore film ratings, genres, and voting patterns.  
The goal of this project is to build a foundation in data analysis and visualization while practicing essential Python skills.

## 📁 Dataset

A small dataset containing 8 popular movies with the following fields:

- **title** – Movie name  
- **year** – Release year  
- **genre** – Category (Action, Sci-Fi, Fantasy, etc.)  
- **rating** – IMDb-style rating  
- **votes** – Number of user votes  

The dataset was manually created for learning purposes.
